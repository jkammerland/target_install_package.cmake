// Implementation file for additional math utilities
// This file provides implementation support for the modules

#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>

// This implementation file doesn't export anything directly,
// but can contain helper functions used by the modules

// Note: In a real C++20 modules implementation, you might have
// module implementation units (.cpp files that belong to modules)
// or additional implementation support.

// For this example, we keep it simple with just the module interface units (.cppm)
